This is my first game in Unity, a remake of a project I did in GameMaker over a decade ago.  I spent a good chunk of time in my teenage
years learning and making a handful of rough games in GameMaker, around 16 years ago.  Im amazed at all the tools and systems available in 
Unity!  It sure beats the features I had to work with in GameMaker back then!

I'm also really enjoying the fact that I'm now able to learn about and implement any system I manage to dream up.  When I was younger I 
quickly ran into walls and did not know how to learn properly.  The biggest challenge lately has been to get to sleep on on time, and 
remember to take breaks from learning and practicing full time.


Mutant Mayhem

This is going to be a fairly simple game, where you try to survive endless waves of mutants.  You must defend your base and 'Quantum Cube'
from the mutants while you collect samples from the vanquished foes to sell back to Mission Control for credits that can be used to 
expand your base, upgrade structures, upgrade your character and weapons, and buy ammo and grenades.  The setting is as follows:  Strange
anomolies have been detected in the far reaches of the galaxy, beyond mankind's foothold.  You have signed up for a job position to help
with "research and development" in the anomolous sector.  Upon being teleported to the planets surface, you start with minimual weaponry
and skills and must defend the location from oncoming waves of mutant creature.  The creatures appear to resemble species from Earth but are
genetically superior to anything we've found.  The initial theory is that the entire planet was used as some kind of biological experiment by
a highly advanced alien lifeform.  The alien oversees have since perished, with ancient ruins remaining on the planet's surface.  

Your goal is to collect samples (chunks of mutants) to send back to the AI driven Mission Control in low orbit, via a fancy Quantum Cube which
allows you to teleport the sample to the ship for analysis, in exchange for credits.  The cube also allows you to buy new weapons, upgrades, 
structures, and ammo.

The player will be able to construct walls, turrets, and gates in order to defend the cube and still exit to gather samples.  I've also played
around with the idea of adding a power grid to the base.  The player will need to construct spot lights and wall lights in order to see the
mutants outside the walls, and allow for the turrets to shoot the enemies.

I have a few ideas for a more linear game experience, but right now I'm just focussed on getting the core mechanics into the game.  If I 
do add another play mode, the current "survival mode" will still be available.

The game is nearly at it's minimal playable state so I figured it is time to start sharing it!

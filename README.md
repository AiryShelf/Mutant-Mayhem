# Mutant-Mayhem
My first game in Unity, a remake of a project I did in GameMaker over a decade ago.

Im amazed at all the tools and systems available in Unity!  It sure beats the features I had to work with in GameMaker around 16 years ago.

I'm really enjoying the fact that I'm now able to learn about and implement any system I manage to dream up.  The biggest challenge
so far has been to get to sleep on on time, and remembering to take breaks from learning full time.



Mutant Mayhem

This is going to be a fairly simple game, where you try to survive endless waves of mutants.  You must defend your base and 'Quantum Cube'
from the mutants while you collect samples from the vanquished foes to sell back to Mission Control for credits that can be used to 
expand your base, upgrade structures, upgrade your character and weapons, and buy ammo and grenades.

I have a few ideas for a more linear game experience, but right now I'm just focussed on getting the core mechanics into the game.  If I 
do add another play mode, the current "survival mode" will still be available.



The game is nearly at it's minimal playable state so I figured it is time to start sharing it!

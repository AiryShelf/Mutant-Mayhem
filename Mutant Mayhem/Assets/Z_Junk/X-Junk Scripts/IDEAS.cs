{
    /*
        Have wall of fire slowly chasing the player in a direction.
        Player is drunk and needs to Sober-Up instead of Level-Up
        Mutants throw boots at player
        Mutants leave piles of toxic vomit, projectile vomit

        Upgradable drones to follow you and help fight.  
        Add components and then need to upgrade chassis to add more (update sprite)

        Drones as player helpers, upgradable.

        Melee weapon can be upgradeable with size, as well as Energy Wave that goes through enemies
            even as just a simple slash effect moving out.

        for a tower defence style level, it could be set on a bridge with cracks and 
            holes in the bridge, with a parallax background.  neat.  multiple levels to choose?

        For a linear gameplay idea, there could be "stages" where you defend a spot for a bit until
            enough samples are collected, and are then forced to move on for a while.  Maybe there is
            a giant fire sweeping through the area?  Need samples before they are all fried.  After a 
            bit, BAM! a quantum cube slams into the ground ahead of you (killing mutants) with a popup
            message.  "We have detected multiple anomolies in the area.  Recover specimen samples for 
            experimentation."  Then, defend the cube again, build up defenses. new enemies here.
        The ship is only available during day due to anomolous space weather.


        Building ideas:

        BUILD MODE NEEDS A TABLET!
        Can have concrete ground to place for movement

        Doors could have less health than walls, but need the doors to go collect pickups.
            Return the pickups to Quantum Cube for payment?  Could have body parts to pickup and send off,
            think hearts, brains (or viable chunks of brains/parts) and organs. They could be highlighted
            in the carnage, animated like throbbing.
        
        Laser gates?

        How should the upgrade system work?
        How about the repair system?


        ANIMATE THE GUN ACCURACY!  ROTATE PLAYER ACCORDINGLY.
            Could also animate the building such that the buildings come flying down from the ship and
            land in the flashing outline of the building with a boom. and maybe 3d sound so it sounds
            like it comes form behind and goes down.
            
            Otherwise, having a construction laser or drone will work.
        
        Footprints?
